Dolor is an emerging applications developer in Seattle; passionate to guide and inspire others to the top, 
she is here to represent the ability to have fun and be successful at the same time. Having the determination 
to learn more about web development, she has taken the task into her own hands. Code Academy certifications 
and multiple self-learning methods, Dolor has gotten familiar with front-end developer skills; including HTML,
JavaScript, and CSS. Customer service awards present receipts of the go above and beyond. Traveling gets my 
mind off of stress and clears my head, allowing me to keep myself on the right track.
